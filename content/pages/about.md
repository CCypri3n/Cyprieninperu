My name is Cyprien and I am traveling to Peru for 12 months starting in August 2025 as part of a voluntary social year. I am living in Miguel Grau, a small village in the Andes, and supporting the coffee cooperative "CACI Satinaki." Among other things, I am working in the fields, in the laboratory, and in public relations. On this blog, I will take you along on my journey into my unfamiliar everyday life and show you how beautiful Peru, its people, and its coffee are.
If you would like to support this project, you are welcome to donate and share this blog.
