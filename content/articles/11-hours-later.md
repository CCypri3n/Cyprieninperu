Summary: Arrival in Miguel Grau, discovering our rooms and the village square. In this article, I tell you about the end of our bus journey and our first days in the village.

… we finally arrived at the Movílbus terminal in Pichanaki. It was around 7 in the morning, but the city of 20,000 inhabitants had long been awake. All kinds of vehicles—mototaxis, pick-up trucks, and small lorries—zipped along the multilane main road. The air was filled with swirling dust and the acrid exhaust of the traffic. Tired but excited, Erik and I waited for Aurelia, with whom I’d been coordinating our arrival.

From the outside, the terminal looked like a garage, but inside it had a few rows of seats and a small counter. About an hour later, a dark grey pick-up truck arrived, with Aurelia and a few others inside. So here they were—the team we were going to live and work with for an entire year:

- Elvis, in his forties, describes himself as a happy man: “As long as there’s beer, coffee, and women.” A rock-’n’-roll fan who’s rarely seen without his motorcycle.
- Aurelia, head of the quality-control lab, Q-Grader for CACI Satinaki for the past eight years, and mother to Mavi. She always has the lab’s best coffee and best chocolate.
- Blanca, our host mother for the year, who feeds us with her cooking and helps us settle into her home.
- Mavi, part-time princess, who brings joy and sunshine to the lab every day.

We enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and chatted together. The food was delicious: bread, eggs, and yuca, a root vegetable with a potato-like flavor. Fried yuca is even better—crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. A real treat!

About an hour later, we were already on the road to Yurinaki. During the drive, we made a brief stop by the roadside, where a small wooden hut with a leaf roof was selling coconuts “to go.” Apart from Erik and me, no one seemed surprised by this improvised drive-through. After another hour on the road and a brand-new drink in hand, we reached Yurinaki, the closest town to Miguel Grau. Without much explanation—a cultural habit I’d soon have to get used to—we made a short stop there. Erik and I took the chance to explore the surroundings a bit, without straying too far into this still-unknown territory.

The town of about 1,500 inhabitants has at its center a beautiful green park with a stone stage in the middle. A road circles around it, lined with small shops and restaurants.

We then left Yurinaki on a small road leading into the mountains. Far from the dense traffic of the cities, the air was pleasant: the sun warmed our skin, birds chirped in the trees, and a light breeze brushed our faces through the open windows. After about forty minutes of driving—punctuated by anecdotes and incredible views—we arrived at Blanca’s house. It’s an old stone house with a corrugated-metal roof. Several wooden structures scattered around shelter chickens, geese, and friends—plus an old Jeep and a workshop full of tools.

One of us would stay in the only room on the first floor, while the other would stay in David’s newer, more modern house. This second house, only a few minutes away, looks a lot like a European home, with a large terrace and several rooms with private bathrooms on the upper floor.

Although I was supposed to sleep in the newer house, we had to swap rooms quickly because of Erik’s allergies. I have to admit that this change was tough for me at first. For those who know me: I’m not exactly a fan of insects. And this “new” room had practically no insulation—no glass window, just a plastic tarp for a ceiling. I quickly came into contact with all sorts of insects: a wasp stung me right in the chest, mosquitoes swarmed around my bed, and so on. Fortunately, I soon got a mosquito net and began to slowly (very slowly) get used to these little creatures. Ah, and the chickens? Unforgettable—especially their 3-a.m. alarm clock routine.

All in all, these first days were fantastic: discovering the lab, our work, meeting new friends, and getting our first introduction to Peruvian cuisine—which I’ll write more about in a separate article. The immersion is complete, and it’s genuinely fascinating to discover this new culture, one I knew nothing about before. I’ll let the next photos speak for themselves.

¡Buenos días y hasta la próxima!

Cyprien
