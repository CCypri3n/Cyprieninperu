*Although I’ve been in Peru for more than three weeks—well, almost two months—I hadn’t posted anything yet… until today! So let me tell you about those first few days in Lima, which served as preparation for my placement in Miguel Grau.*

***

Everything began on Friday, August 22. That day, the other volunteers and I boarded our flight to Lima, with a layover in Bogotá. Exhausted, a bit out of sorts, and loaded down with my three pieces of luggage, we finally arrived at our hostel at 3 a.m. The Flying Dog immediately gave me a taste of what I had signed up for. Our room, for example, looked out onto an aloe vera plant hanging on a brick wall. We also got along pretty easily with our neighbors (luckily, they were volunteers too), because the wall didn’t reach the ceiling and one window stayed permanently open. A bit farther down the hallway, I discovered Peruvian bathrooms for the first time: toilet paper strictly forbidden, unless you want to clog the pipes! The bathroom, home to a few spiders and insects acting as “pets,” at least had hot water… Looking back, none of this was actually so bad—you just have to adapt!

After a few hours of sleep, we started the day with a light breakfast and a meeting with Doris, our local Ecoselva mentor who will accompany us throughout the year.

In the afternoon, we explored Miraflores, one of Lima’s wealthiest and most touristy districts—which also happened to be where our hostel was—and we visited the Pacific Ocean, where I unfortunately soaked the first of the four pairs of pants I had brought…

We also checked out the area around the hostel: a really nice bar with excellent Pisco Sours, big green parks filled with stray cats to pet or adopt, and a multi-day coffee market with tons of fascinating stands. Meals were taken care of by Ecoselva: lunch at an Arab restaurant, dinner at a Chinese one. The latter didn’t win many hearts— not only was the food pretty mediocre, but out of misguided curiosity, I ordered an aloe-vera drink. Imagine buying aloe-vera shampoo at the grocery store, then mixing in chunks of fruit yogurt—that’s exactly what it tasted like for me and 90% of the volunteers. But I shouldn’t complain: if our year were made only of perfect experiences, we’d be bored stiff—and I wouldn’t have absurd stories to tell. Like the scooter that suddenly drove into the restaurant during dinner…

Away from police patrols and cleaning crews, we discovered a very different side of the city. Lima, a metropolis of 11 million people, is marked by stark contrasts between wealth and poverty. We visited Villa María del Triunfo, a pueblo joven—a low-income neighborhood mainly inhabited by migrants from the Andes. The ride there was quite an experience: traffic laws are more like suggestions, seatbelts are optional accessories, and drivers use the horn more often than the brakes.

Once there, we were introduced to an urban-agriculture project. About fifteen years ago, a group of women decided to beautify the local landscape. Since construction is prohibited under electrical pylons, they secured permission to grow fruits and vegetables there. The beginning was tough—few people believed in the project. To protect the crops from thieves, the women built a makeshift fence out of tires, planks, and corrugated metal sheets.

Today, the project has expanded to other districts and now includes many families cultivating small plots. Some sell their produce, others grow food for their own use. All the gardens are arranged with a lot of love. At noon, we were invited to another garden in the project to enjoy a meal prepared with their fresh vegetables—absolutely delicious! Then we headed back to the hostel through Lima’s chaotic traffic.

I spent the rest of the day at the last session of Semana del Café, hidden among clouds of warm coffee aromas and the lively crowds. I met some interesting people, including a tattoo artist drawing temporary coffee-themed tattoos. Theo and I chatted with him about his life and work in Peru—giving him a much-needed break. Later, I exchanged contacts with several vendors from whom I bought sweaters, a fanny pack, and a new pair of pants. Because I have to admit: I packed terribly. Despite making a careful list and preparing everything meticulously, I forgot the most essential thing—myself. I left behind clothes, games, and other important and useful things in Germany. And what I did bring—like pants and t-shirts—isn’t nearly enough. As my best friend would say: “Life is hard.” I can’t change it now, so I’ve accepted it and adapted!

We were supposed to meet with a woman from the German embassy to get information about the country and our volunteer ID card. In Peru, you often need a number called the CNI (código único de identificación), which appears on the card. It’s essential for using Yape (a digital payment service, similar to PayPal, accepted almost everywhere), but also for hostels and big purchases. Unfortunately, the meeting didn’t happen because she was sick. Honestly, that worked out well—we finally had time to buy SIM cards.

We took the bus to Lima’s historic center. Anyone who complains about the crowded public transportation in Germany wouldn’t even be able to step inside a Lima bus. They were so packed that we had to twist ourselves more than in a game of Twister. Getting off was just as entertaining: you simply shout “¡Bajo!” and “¡Pásame!”

Back to the historic center: the impressive buildings date back to the Spanish colonial period, which began in 1535. When Lima was founded as the “City of Kings,” it became the seat of the Viceroyalty of Peru—one of the most important political and economic hubs of the Spanish Empire in South America. Wealthy settlers, the Church, and the colonial administration invested heavily in lavish churches, grand palaces, and well-preserved houses to display their power and wealth. Local materials such as brick, wood, and stone were crafted with great skill. We saw all of this during our visit to this UNESCO World Heritage Site. The historic center felt like a step back in time, with the beautifully preserved Plaza Mayor and our tour of the San Francisco monastery. While wandering through the streets, I also noticed how the urban landscape shifted: between the skyscrapers and modern buildings, a few historic structures remained—often now used by government offices.

We ended the evening at the Parque de la Reserva, watching a water show while snacking on churros.

After another meeting with Doris, we headed to the tourist district of Barranco. We strolled along the seaside promenade and enjoyed the Pacific—where only a handful of brave souls (including me) dared to swim. Because it was so cold, the swimmers took a taxi back to the hostel. After some fresh empanadas, Jannes, Theo, and I ended the night with a Pizza Hut dinner!

Since we were all leaving Lima at different times and Doris wanted to be around, nothing official was planned for our last day. Erik and I had an afternoon meeting with David, the director of CACI Satinaki, where we’ll work and live for the year. He explained a lot: who we’d be living and working with, details about traveling in the region, and more.

That evening, we left. In Peru, people often travel long-distance by bus, and the comfort level is far better than in Germany. There are large terminals for the different companies, complete with luggage check-in, and the buses are fantastic: wide, comfortable seats that recline 160 or even 180 degrees. So the ride to Pichanaki was looking pretty good! What happened 11 hours later will be the subject of the next article.

Stay tuned,

Buena semana y hasta la próxima!
