Hey!

My name is Cyprien, and I'm the person behind this blog. 

I'm doing a voluntary social year (FSJ) with the association [Ecoselva](https://ecoselva.org) in Miguel Grau, a very small village in the heart of the Peruvian mountain rainforest. In this blog, I want to share my experiences, insights, and travels from this fantastic year.

Stay tuned for more posts—I can't wait to share my adventures here!

Best regards,

Cyprien
