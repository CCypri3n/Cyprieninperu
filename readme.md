# Cyprien in Peru - Personal Blog

This Github is hosting the files for my personal "Cyprien in Peru" Blog over at [cyprieninperu.netlify.app](https://cyprieninperu.netlify.app/).

It was build with the help of [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a great SSG built with python. I am using the standard theme, though i have adapted it to my needs, with support for the i18 translation plugin as well as the customization of different pages.

I have included a few plugins, to be able to easily incorporate carousels directly inside my markdown files.

## TO-DO

- [ ] Get the first real articles going.
- [ ] Update about page.
- [ ] Update urls.
- [ ] translate atom feed name and change position.
