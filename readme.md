# Cyprien in Peru - Personal Blog

This Github is hosting the files for my personal "Cyprien in Peru" Blog over at [cyprieninperu](https://cyprieninperu.netlify.app/).

It was build with the help of [Pelican](https://getpelican.com), a great SSG built with python. I am using the standard theme, though i have adapted it to my needs, with support for the i18 translation plugin as well as the customization of different pages. I have also added support of the OpenGraph protocol.

I have included a few plugins, to be able to easily incorporate carousels directly inside my markdown files.

## TO-DO
